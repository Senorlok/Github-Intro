GitHub Pages: a web hosting service for hosting static web pages.

* To create a web environment, create a branch of the repo, and name it 'gh-pages'.
* Make the branch the default branch, and delete the master branch if you wish.

* Files in gh-pages can be accessed directly by going to the web deployment page, and adding "NAME_FILE.EXT". There should be not spaces and an extension in the file name.
* The file 'index.html' would be the default file displayed on the page.

CNAME: An extensionless file created within 'gh-pages', that contains the custom domain to forward to.
